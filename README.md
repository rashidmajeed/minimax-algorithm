# minimax-algorithm
Friend wanted to implement minimax algorithm, this is me looking at what it is.

minimax is type of backtracking algorithm

# backtracking
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking

Can be applied only for problems which admit the concept of a "partial candidate solution"

# partial candiate solution
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/candidate-partial-solution

"The local search process is started by selecting an initial candidate solution, and then proceeds by iteratively moving from one candidate solution to a neighbouring candidate solution"

Entirely speculating/guessing:
This sounds like it just means you can check "one solution" (choose one of 9 positions on tic-tac-toe board to place an X) vs a next one (instead of open position (1,1) choose the next open position, e.g. (3,1))
